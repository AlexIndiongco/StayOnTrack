"Predicting Program Retention Among School of Engineering and Architecture Students at Holy Angel University Using XGBoost Algorithm"

**Abstract:**
  This study investigates the use of the XGBoost algorithm to predict student retention among engineering and architecture students at Holy Angel University. Financial barriers and high tuition rates are increasingly challenging students' ability to complete their degrees. Accurate retention prediction is crucial for effective institutional planning and support. The research analyzes a comprehensive database of undergraduate students, including academic performance, socio-demographics, and general institutional data. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student retention and develop a reliable forecasting model using machine learning techniques. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 88.83% and a balanced F1-score of 94.07%. The analysis also showed that the number of passed subjects and enrollment status had the strongest positive correlation (0.26), while the number of passed and failed subjects had the strongest negative correlation (-0.87). The questionnaire, which involved 6 participants from the field experts and SEA Department Heads, gathered an average score of 6.18, with an interpreted value of "Strongly Agree" indicating strong agreement with the application's ability to meet expectations.
